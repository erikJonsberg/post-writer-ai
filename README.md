# AI blog post writer

## Overview

Enter a title for your article. Enter three or more keywords or phrases. GPT generates an SEO-friendly blog post of any length in any language.

The goal of this Assistant is to write articles that are as close to human-sounding as possible. It avoids AI-sounding syntax, such as vague descriptions and repetitious phrases. It also avoids using over-used AI words like "delve" and "tapestry."

However, as with any AI-generated content, you will need to edit the article to include human experience, anecdotes, and humor/wordplay.

This project is in progress. It will be bundled with Summarizr as a SaaS.
