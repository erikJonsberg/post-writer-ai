# AI blog post wroter

## Overview

Enter a title for your article. Enter three or more keywords. GPT generates an SEO-friendly blog post.

This project was built back in the days of the `pages router` and it uses `text-davinci-003` or `gtp-3.5-turbo`. You can tell that the articles it generates are AI. It's actually pretty comical because they read like they were written by someone with schizophrenia.

But it's a great concept and I'd love to circle back to this and get it working on the `app router` with `gpt-4o`. The database is set up and it's got Auth0 and Stripe, so it's just a matter of bringing into the 21st century.

## To do list

- port to `app router`
- change auth to Clerk
- Update Stripe
- update the API with better prompts and `gpt-4o`
